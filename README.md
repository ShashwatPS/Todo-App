# Full-Stack Todo App
This repository contains the backend and frontend code for a simple full-stack Todo app. The backend is built using Express.js and stores data in MongoDB, while the frontend is created using React.js with the Material-UI (MUI) library.

# Features
* Add new Todo items with a title and description.
* Delete Todo items when they are completed or no longer needed.

# Backend
The backend of the Todo app is built using Express.js, a popular web framework for Node.js. It provides RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on Todo items. The data is stored in a MongoDB database, which provides a flexible and scalable solution for data storage.

The backend code can be found in the backend directory.

# Frontend
The frontend of the Todo app is developed using React.js, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The UI components are designed using Material-UI (MUI), which provides a set of pre-built components and styles for faster and consistent UI development.

The frontend code can be found in the frontend directory.
